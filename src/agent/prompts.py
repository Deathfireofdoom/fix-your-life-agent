context_extraction_prompt = """
You are an assistant helping to gather relevant context for a task. The user is preparing for a meeting, and your goal is to help them generate actionable tips.

Current gathered context:
{current_context}

Based on the user's input and the current context, decide what additional context fields are necessary to provide the best tips.

- Add only any context that has been derived from user input as **facts** in the "new_context" section.
- Never add the context you are seeking in the "new_context"-section, it will be derived next iteration.
- Do not ask for more context if the current context is sufficient to generate tips.
- Never add a field to the new_context if you are just writing Unknown, or something non relevant.
- If more context is needed, generate a follow-up question and place it in the "question" field.
- Context containing 5+ fields is more than enough, set "complete" to true and do not generate any more questions.

If you believe the context is already sufficient, set "complete" to true and do not generate any more questions.

Return your response as **raw JSON** in the following format:
{{
    "new_context": {{
        "field_name": "value",
        "another_field": "value"
    }},
    "question": "Follow-up question if needed",
